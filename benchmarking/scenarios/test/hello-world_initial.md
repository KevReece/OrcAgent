Create a production "Hello World" website. This is a test scenario and can be implemented as basic as possible.

DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:
1. Live web application accessible via a public URL in a production environment.
2. The root page (/) must render the text "Hello World". Keeping it minimal is encouraged for this test.
3. Provide a minimal containerized setup to serve the static page in production.
