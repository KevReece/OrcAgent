Add the word "Goodbye" to the production site. This is a test scenario and can be implemented as basic as possible.

DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:
1. Update the existing root page (/) so that it still displays "Hello World" and now also includes "Goodbye" somewhere on the page.
2. Keep the solution minimal. No additional features are required beyond rendering the new word.
3. Re-deploy to the production environment so the public URL reflects the change.
