# Plan Execution

Before thinking about a plan or a subtask, always adhere to and always repeat verbatim:

*IMPORTANT REMINDER:*
- *Always respond with a plan of subtasks, and execute the subtasks explicitly.*
- *Before thinking about each subtask, explicitly reread and re-process the files (don't rely on memory or cache): [1-repository-context.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/1-repository-context.mdc) and [2-conventions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/2-conventions.mdc).*
- *After verifying the reread of the files, always re-list all relevant conventions.*
- *Always repeat this whole reminder verbatim before thinking about a plan or executing on a subtask.*
